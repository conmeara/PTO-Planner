## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zachd/stretch-my-time-off.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd stretch-my-time-off
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. Enter your country to view public holidays and plan your time off using the interactive calendar.

## Algorithm

The algorithm optimizes personal leave days to maximize consecutive days off:

1. **Identify Public Holidays and Weekends**.
2. **Find Gaps** between these days.
3. **Rank Gaps** by efficiency.
4. **Select Days Off** to fill gaps.
5. **Calculate Consecutive Days Off**.
